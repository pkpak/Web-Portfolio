      <h2>Creator's Statement</h2>
      <p>The visual argument I’ve put together is meant to emphasize one core concept; perspective. Specifically, perspective as discussed in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which dictates in its strong version that language determines how you see the world. In a visually analogous way, I wanted to emphasize not only the effect of one’s own lenses, but also the influential effect of the lenses that ideas and messages are passed through before any one person comes into contact with them. Through the use of overlapping images to reduce the amount of negative space, I attempted to visually represent the lack of space given to media consumers to attempt to break down what they’re seeing, and how a message’s content and meaning are molded by the lenses they’re passed through. The dove at the center of the image was a deliberate choice; although enough of it can be seen to determine what it once was, it has been obscured and framed to the point where its meaning by being present in the picture can be reasonably understood to convey something entirely different from what doves typically mean. <br />
	This effect of framing is center to the image’s meaning; that’s precisely why there is text directly prompting the audience to question what they’re seeing, especially with the word “see” being in magenta, a color that’s only possible because of how our bodies are unable to process the corresponding wavelength of light properly. In prompting the audience to question what they’re seeing, there are three things I would aspire to have this visual argument further encourage them to do; attempt to trace the idea they’re consuming back to its source, consider how their own lenses affect the ideas they consume, and consider what lenses ideas in their lives have already been passed through before being delivered to them. Ideally, all three would apply, giving the viewer a better ability to think critically about and learn from the rhetoric they’re exposed to in their lives. The target demographic for this visual argument would be people under 30, as they’re the most easily influenced and likely to come across this image on platforms like Instagram and Twitter, and have the most time and space to employ any skills they gain from this.

    <h2>Explanation of the Assignment</h2>
      <p>The Visual Argument is an expansion on the concepts presented in the Soundscape Narrative; students are challenged to further think through a digital lens by using image manipulation software, and are inadverdently shown the dramatic difference digitization makes because of the vast capabilities when contrasted to traditional visual media like painting. While more restricted in terms of needing a core message or argument, this assignment is still, creatively speaking, very much so open for creativity. Any message or argument will do, so long as it can be explained and understood through the image produced.</p>
