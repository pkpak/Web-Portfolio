 <h1>Site Synopsis</h1>
 <p>site is essentially meant to present the major projects from this class and explain my experience with them to give any prospective students an insight into how the class is.</p>
 <h2>Class Synopsis & Opinion</h2>
 <p>(will need to actually write out, similar to creator's statements, will help collect ideas for final reflection)the class is engaging and interesting and makes for a good gen ed and/or writing intensive choice because there's a higher chance you'll be interested in the material, making the work a lot easier. class deals generally with themes of presentation and audience perspective, while also letting students engage first hand with creator's perspective in the major projects. i would think it provokes a lot of thought as to the effect of digital mediums on media and how drastically different basic communication has become because of technology (the alteration in brain function alone is super interesting, would looooove to do an age striated fMRI study but thats expensive :( ) that said, i didn't get a ton of that engagement primarily because I took the course over the summer while also having 2 jobs + other engagements/responsibilities/time sucks to pay attention to. Overall, good class to take for gen eds, and if it's a major course for you you'll probably love it (provided you like your major?)</p>
