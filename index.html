 <h2>Class Synopsis & Opinion</h2>
 <div align="left">
 <p>In my opinion, I have an overall very positive opinion of Composing Digital Media as a class, especially as someone who took it to fill a gen ed requirement. The class is far more engaging than most of the other writing intensive options available, due primarily to the fact that the subjects about which you write are far more engaging than something like Shakespearean literature. The majority of the writing for this class is centered around the projects you create; a Soundscape Narrative and a Visual Argument, which ask you to utilize digital media to communicate some sort of message or idea. I personally found this much more engaging to write about because I knew the material I was writing about much better than some randomly assigned book or paper, and because of the relatively free range of topics you can choose from for the projects, I was also much more interested in what I was writing about.

    Moreover, the skills taught in the class are actually applicable after the class ends. You’re given lessons in basic HTML coding through a textbook, and eventually will use it to create something like the website you’re reading this in now. This coding knowledge, while not complex, is applicable in a wide variety of professions and fields, along with the digital media comprehension skills gained by creating, engaging with, and analyzing digital media within the class.
    <br /> 
    <br />
    In conclusion, if you’re looking for an interesting and engaging class to take to fill a gen ed, or just to take out of interest, I would highly recommend taking Composing Digital Media.
